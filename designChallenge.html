					<h2>What is the problem you’re trying to solve?</h2>
					<h5 id="headerChallenge">Eradicating hunger in Charlotte, NC through providing free meals in accesible locations, to those of all backgrounds.</h5>
					<ol>
					<li><h3>Take a stab at framing it as a design question.</h3><l1></l1>
					<p>How could meals and groceries be provided for those who would otherwise go without? And, how can the online presence be elevated for this to be as easy as possible?</p>
					<li><h3>Now, state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have.</h3></li>
					<p>Allowing families and individuals the opportunity to live healthier lives and have more energy to do whatever they do with excellence. Food matters.</p>
					<li><h3>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h3></li>
					<p>Having an opening page that directs to two homepages: one for those in need and one for those looking to give. Simplifying the amount of color and reducing text to make it a faster experience for users. Creating a digital pantry to manage stock and help families make wise choices. Having digital forms to sign up to serve or to give financially. Inviting newcomers in with high quality photos and engaging content.</p>
					<li><h3>Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing.</h3></li>
					<p>Time. Big dreams and a short timeline. This can be overcome by managing time well and focusing in on what matters most.</p>
					<li><h3>Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.</h3></li>
					<p>How do I create a place for the hungry to find food and the fed to share what they have through a straightforward digital platform?</p>
