            </header>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is your role in the organization?</h4>
                    <l1>
                    <p>As the Marketing and Events Director, I am responsible for sharing the Loaves & Fishes story, raising awareness in the community, communicating our mission and making sure that those who need our services know we are here. I also make sure our message and branding are consistent.</p>
                    </l1>
                <li>
                    <h4>What past experience led you here?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>I first came in contact with Loaves & Fishes as the Community Projects Manager for WCNC-TV in Charlotte. I was responsible for promoting our sponsorship of the Loaves & Fishes Scouting for Food Drive. I wanted to get involved so I began as a food drive volunteer, then as a member of the board of directors and then eventually I joined the staff as Marketing Director. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>What means the most to you about your organization? </h4>
                </li>
                <p>I work with an incredible team of people who all believe - passionately - that no one in our community should go to bed hungry. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Where do you see the most growth?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>The pandemic forced the closing of all 41 Loaves & Fishes brick and mortar food pantries resulting in having to figure out how to feed more people with less volunteers in a whole new way - through drive through mobile pantries. Prior to the pandemic we had never quite figured out how best to provide groceries for those with transportation issues. With the possibility of COVID positive clients not able to leave their homes, we had to figure it out fast. Our home delivery program went from idea to implementation in just a matter of a few short weeks. Since last April, over 10,000 individuals have received a week’s worth of groceries delivered directly to their door. And the potential for even greater impact with home deliveries has grown with the announcement of our merger with Friendship Trays, the local Meals on Wheels program which delivers meals to homebound seniors.</p>
                <li>
                    <h4>What is the work you’re most proud of?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>As an organization, I am most proud of our ability to pivot quickly at the start of the pandemic and feed 50% more people with less volunteers in a whole new way. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I am most proud that as a result of all of our hard work to raise awareness of Loaves & Fishes, our recognition in the community continues to grow. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>What, about the website, matters the most to you?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                    It matters that our website is always up to date and contains answers for every question that a client, a referring partner agency, volunteers, or a donor may have and be informative to someone just trying to learn more about what we do.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>How do you aim to connect with those unfamiliar with your organization?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                    We try to connect with those unfamiliar with us in a variety of ways. For those who are food insecure and need our services but may not know about us, we market to our community partners - human services agencies, houses of worship, schools, medical providers - to let them know we are here to serve the families they work with. We also use traditional media - TV, print, radio, etc… as well as social media to reach potential clients and donors.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Feedback about our website:</h4>
                </li>
                <p>We often receive feedback from reporters, donors and volunteers that our website is very thorough, easy to navigate and provides the information they are looking for. 
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Do you personally interact with the website?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>I am responsible for the content on our website so I am constantly updating information and adding new content.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Why does the work of Loaves & Fishes matter?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Last year, Loaves & Fishes provided a week’s worth of groceries to 120,200 individuals in Mecklenburg Co. Almost half were children.  
                </p>
                <li>
                    <h4>Anything you'd like to add?</h4>
                </li>
                <p>
                    March 1, Loaves & Fishes announced that we are merging with Friendship Trays. The vision of both organizations is for all people in our community to meet their basic hunger needs by having access to nutritious food. We are thrilled for what this will mean for our community.

            <p>
                This interview with Sue Bruce, the marketing director of my organization, gave me insight into the motivation of Loaves and Fishes that I could not find from just visiting their site. It also further encouraged me on how greatly the work of the organization matters.

                        <h4>Who are you? What do you do?</h4>
                    </l1>
                        <p>I am a female Anderson University student. I will be graduating this May with a B.S. in Biochemistry. I currently work for Student Activities on campus as the assistant to the Director and as the Physics Department Teachers Assistant. I recently was accepted into MUSC PharmD program and will be attending there in the Fall. This summer I am getting married to the love of my life, Andrew, and we will be moving to Charleston for the next four years. I love God, watching reality TV, solving problems, and tacos.</p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Have you ever volunteered with an organization aiming to eradicate hunger, specifically on a local level?</h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>In the past I have volunteered for Harvest Hope, South Carolina’s largest food bank that provides 22.6 million meals per year to people across the state.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What past experiences led you to take time out of your day to volunteer? </h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>Growing up in the Christian church and being a believer of Jesus Christ helped me see the importance of giving back to the community. As Christians, we are called to follow Jesus’s example of serving and loving others. Because of my beliefs and values, I find it essential to make time to volunteer.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>How did volunteering there or at another organization impact you? </h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>As someone who loves to help, volunteering at Harvest Hope and other organizations like it has taught me the impact a single person can make in the world. Nonprofit organizations can not be successful in serving the community without the help of the community.</p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What’s your personal view on hunger in the US? </h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>Hunger in the US is a big problem. Millions of children in schools go to bed hungry unknowingly, including in some of the wealthiest areas of the country. I think it is definitely important to combat this issue both proactively and offensively. 
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>What matters to you about a website?</h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        That is easy to navigate and is aesthetically pleasing.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>How often do you make decision based on a website’s look?</h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Very often. If the branding is nice, I will more likely be engaged with what the website has to offer.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Do you go to social media or web platforms first?</h4>
                    </li>
                    <p>Social Media, mainly instagram. I however do receive news updated in my email that I scan over. 
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This student interview was a great reminder to me of how much the design of a website matters and how it is important to make a site visit worth the user’s time.

                            <p>I’m a sophomore Graphic Design major at Anderson University. I’m also minoring in Coding. On campus, I’m a resident advisor, and currently oversee the living area of 31 really fun freshmen girls. When I’m not a school I work in as a design intern at Christ Place Church.</p>

                        </li>
                        <p>I  have! I’ve volunteered with an organization called Good News at Noon. This is a food pantry that makes meals and feeds people in need. 
                        </p>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <p>Growing up in a needy area, my parents emphasized that we can’t turn a blind eye to the needs around us. This, of course, is easier to do when it’s your friends and neighbors who are in need.

                        </li>
                        <p>Volunteering, especially in such a hands-on experience such as giving a meal, makes you realize that needs aren’t always impossible to meet. Often, it’s much easier than we expect.</p>

                            <h4>What’s your personal view on hunger in the US? </h4>
                        </li>
                        <p>Hunger, especially childhood hunger, is a huge issue. Especially in light of the current state of the world, there is a great need.

                        <li>
                            <h4>What about more local hunger?</h4>
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            Where I live, the majority of the population are recent immigrants. Often, these individuals and families don’t have reliable access of food. Many of these families aren’t citizens of the Unites States, and can’t receive the small government assistance. This issue often falls on churches and non-profit organizations for a solution.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Accessibility is an important aspect of a website. Getting information quickly and easily is necessary. 
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            <h4>How often do you make decision based on a website’s look?</h4>
                        </li>
                        <p>
                            I frequently do this! If a website looks low-quality, I assume the organization is not reliable.
                        </p>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Do you go to social media or web platforms first?</h4>
                        </li>
                        <p>I typically look at social media first, but to receive actual information I will look to the website.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Getting to interview a fellow designer was a great privilege. Doing so allowed me to rethink the importance of accessibility and function.
