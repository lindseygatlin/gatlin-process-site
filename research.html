				<p class="info">Who is Loaves and Fishes? Why does their work mattter?</p>
			</header>
			<p>"Loaves & Fishes provides a week’s worth of nutritionally balanced groceries to individuals and families
				experiencing a short-term crisis through a network of 41 emergency food pantries located throughout
				Mecklenburg County."</p>
			<p>In the state of North Carolina, 1 in 7 individuals struggle with hunger and 1 in 5 children struggle.
				It's also been found that eople facing hunger in
				North Carolina are estimated to report needing $719,879,000 more per year to meet their food needs
				(Feeding America). In 2020, Loaves and Fishes provided food to over 120,200 people in Mecklenburg County
				(a county of around 1 million).
				They partner with the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, a large and sucessful food bank in the
				area.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently, their site is a bit inconsistent with the typefaces and iconography. It is also
				challenging/time-consuming to navigate. The inconsistencies magnify the navigational difficulities. The
				buttons on the site also vary greatly which makes navigation even greater of a challenge. The navigation
				menus are also problematic, and some even cut off the words.
			</p>
			<p>
				Loaves and Fishes' current branding could also use a referesh. The symbol feels outdated and even
				unprofessional. Updating their branding will allow the site to have a more cohesive structure.

							<h4>Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers,
								magazines, or journals to know what’s new. This can be news stories of interest,
								relevant scientific research, or anything that could help you in finding a solution to
								the design challenge.</h4>
							<l1></l1>
							<p>Feeding America, a large national organization, found that America has more than enough
								food to feed everyone but, much of it is wasted. They estimate that "...25–40% of food
								grown, processed and transported in the U.S. will never be consumed...". They also
								stated that food is the most wasted thing in the country. End Hunger in America, another
								large organization, opens their site by saying: "Hunger is a foundational problem –
								without addressing it, many of the other challenges faced by our society, from education
								to employment to poverty, are simply insoluble." Hunger is a major issue but, the issue
								of quality food matters as well. Feeding America also explains that "...healthy variety
								of foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean
								protein..." is needed to truly make a difference. Doing the drive thrus seem to be more
								successful than the tradtional pantries in finding volunteers to support them.</p>
						<li>
							<h4>Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be
								technological, behavioral, or cultural. </h4>
						</li>
						<p>For my organization, the COVID-19 pandemic presented them with new challenges in getting what
							they had to those in need. One solution they found to be sucessful are their Pop Up Food
							Shares. These events allow participants to pre-reigster online and stop by a central
							location to drive thru and receieve fresh produce, meat, and dairy. Attending a Pop Up event
							like this does not count in the pantry visits each indivual is alloted per calendar
							year—allowing them a chance to be provided with more. They have also switched their normal
							pantry operations to be drive thru style as well.</p>
						<li>
							<h4>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h4>
						</li>
						<p>It could be important to create a digital space where information about and directions to
							mobile pantry sites would be beneficial. It would also be helpful to consider ways to ensure
							that pantry sites are as sustainable as possible to not contribute to the astonishing amount
							of wasted food. A focus on the mobile experience will also be important.</p>
						<li>
							<h4>Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are
								there any that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired
								you to make one of your own? </h4>
						</li>
						<p>There do not seem to be any similar solutions in the Charlotte area. The other major supplier
							(and partner of Loaves and Fishes) is Second Harvest Food Bank; but, their site is very
							volunteer directed and finding how to recieve food is more challenging. It is also hard to
							use on a mobile device which can be more accesible than a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

							<h4>Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve
								the design challenge?</h4>
						</li>
						<p>1 in 7 individuals in NC not knowing where they will get their next meal suggests that
							something is not working. Especially with COVID-19, websites matter more than before.
							Devoting time to this site could help others get the assitance they need.</p>
